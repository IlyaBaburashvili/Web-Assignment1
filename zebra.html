    <h1>Zebra</h1>
    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Our planet is home to three different species of zebra, the plains zebra, Grevy’s zebra and mountain zebra, all three species are native to Africa.
    </br>
    </br>
    The most common species is the plains zebra, which roams grasslands and woodland of eastern and southern Africa. 
    </br>
    </br>   
    Closely related to horses, zebras have thick bodies, thin legs, a tufted tail, and a long head and neck sporting a short mane.
    </br>
    </br>
    Their stripes perhaps serve to dazzle and confuse predators and biting insects, or to control the animal’s body heat. Because each individual’s stripes are unique, their stripes may also have a social purpose, helping zebras to recognise one other.

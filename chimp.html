    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Chimpanzees are one of four types of “great ape.” The great apes are: chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans.
    </br>
    </br>
    Wild chimpanzees only live in Africa.
    </br> 
    </br>  
    Humans and chimpanzees share 95 to 98 percent of the same DNA. Biologically, chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas.
    </br>
    </br>
    Chimpanzees and other species, including some types of birds, make and use tools. For a long time, scientists thought human beings were the only ones who made tools.

    <h1>Lion</h1>
    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p> Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western India. 
    </br>
    </br>
    On average, males weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone).  They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. 
    </br>    
    </br>
    Male lions grow impressive manes the older they get. These manes grow up to 16cm long and are a sign of dominance. The older they get, the darker their manes go.   As well as attracting females, their manes may also protect their neck and head from injuries during fights.
    </br>
    </br> 
    A pride of lions is usually made up of related females and their cubs, plus a male or small group of males who defend their pride. The lionesses rear their cubs together and cubs can suckle from any female with milk. 
    </br>
    </br>
    Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get most of their water from their prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon.
